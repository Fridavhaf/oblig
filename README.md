Hello!


This is my oblig1 where I am making a ticket form.

Input validation is checked for all input fields.
The functions validating the input are different 
depending on the attributes that are going into the array.

Some rules:
International letters æ, ø, å, ä, ü, ë etc. is allowed for name.
Phone number is with eight digits (standard norwegian without the +47).
Simple regex for mail that allows a lot, but not all special signs like +%&$'^ etc.

You have to insert something in the input fields before buying a ticket, or an error occurs.
You will also get error if the input does not meet the criteria.


PS: I did a bit of styling, which usually is better to put in a linked CSS.
But I thought it was important to only deliver HTML, JS and README for this task.
