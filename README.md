This is my oblig1 where I am making a ticket form.

Input validation is checked for all input fields.

The functions validating the input are different 
depending on the attributes that are going into the array.

Some rules:
You can write one first name, one last name, 
a phone number that is with eight digits (standard norwegian without the +47),
an email address with some letters/numbers/signs @, and then som letters/numbers

You have to insert something in the input fields before buying a ticket, or an error occurs.
You will also get error if the input does not meet the criteria.
All error messages comes with a explanation.
